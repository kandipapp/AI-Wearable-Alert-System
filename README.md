# AI-Wearable-Alert-System (AWAS)
An AI-powered wearable system, the **AI Wearable Alert System (AWAS)**, designed to enhance situational awareness for the deaf and hard of hearing. This project detects critical environmental sounds using a machine learning model and wirelessly transmits alerts to a custom 3D-printed gauntlet, which provides haptic and visual feedback to the user.
